      <p>Let&rsquo;s turn Harris County so Blue in 2020 that we flip the whole
      State of Texas!</p>

      <p>Our motto: Don&rsquo;t just vote&hellip;volunteer!</p>

      <p>Join us! Our mission is to:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Flip State House Districts (HD) <a href="/files/HD-134-SARAH-DAVIS-MAP-WITH-PRECINCT-NUMBERS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">134</a> and <a href="/files/HD-138-BOHAC-MAP-WITH-PRECINCT-NUMBERS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">138</a></li>

      <li>Turnout Infrequent Voters in HD <a href="/files/HD-146-MAP-WITH-PRECINCT-NUMBERS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">146</a></li>

      <li>Hold Congressional District <a href="/files/CD7-LIZZIE-FLETCHER-MAP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TX-7</a>, HD <a href="/files/HD-132-GINA-MAP-WITH-PRECINCT-NUMBERS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">132</a>, and HD <a href="/files/HD-135-JOHN-MAP-WITH-PRECINCT-NUMBERS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">135</a></li>

      </ul>

      <p>We need your help to be successful and the stakes couldn&rsquo;t be higher. From our successful efforts in 2018 alongside local and state campaigns, including Lizzie Fletcher, we learned important lessons we can leverage to expand our efforts for 2020.</p>

      <p>We will provide training, strategy, and tactics&hellip;and we&rsquo;ll have fun along the way! Bring your friends!</p>

      <p>Through our volunteer efforts, we will work &ldquo;smart&rdquo; together to elect Democrats in the Houston area by registering new voters, increasing voter turnout, and educating constituents about races up and down the ballot.</p>
