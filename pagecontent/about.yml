      <p>The focus of this group is to build sustainable year-round
      people-focused organizing in the Harris County/Houston area through
      training and developing relationships between individual organizers as
      well as progressive grassroots organizations so we can support each
      other.</p>

      <p>We specifically work to register and engage new voters in areas that are traditionally not reached by campaigns or other organizations; apartments and neighborhoods that are packed with Democratic voters who do not vote regularly. When possible we prefer to knock doors and talk to people in person, but we also drop literature, phone bank, text, and write letters and postcards.&nbsp;</p>
